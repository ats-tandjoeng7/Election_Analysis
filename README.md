## Challenge Overview
Module 3 assignment consists of Python coding exercises and a detailed analysis of how we supported the election commission with some additional data analytics to complete the audit requirements. It consists of two technical deliverables and a written report to deliver our results as follows.
- ‚òëÔ∏è Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line
- ‚òëÔ∏è Deliverable 2: The Election Results Saved to a Text File
- ‚òëÔ∏è Deliverable 3: A written Analysis of the Election Audit (this ["README.md"](./README.md))

### Purpose
Our goal is to provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of our methods. As with all written analyses, this will help our audience understand what we did and what they might be able to do with the data we presented.
